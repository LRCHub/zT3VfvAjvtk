Is it whiskey tonight, or is it something different?
What's on your mind, about the girl you're missing?
Her eyes, her smile, her silhouette?
I let you slur, let you vent, even though I know I'll never get
Sober, sober, sober you
No, I'll never get sober, sober, sober you
You say you'll never be who you were
Say you'll never get over her
So I'll never get sober, sober, sober you
Sober you
Two-thirty again, you're typing out that last-call text
About to hit send, and I know what happens next
You come over, cry over her leaving
You don't know,
You ain't the only one tryin' to let go, I'll never get
Sober, sober, sober you
No, I'll never get sober, sober, sober you
You say you'll never be who you were
Say you'll never get over her
So I'll never get sober, sober, sober you
Sober you
I don't say those words 'cause it's not worth it
But we'd be perfect, so what hurts is
I'll never get sober, sober, sober you
No, I'll never get sober, sober, sober you
I'll never get
Sober, sober, sober you
No, I'll never get sober, sober, sober you
You say you'll never be who you were
Say you'll never get over her
So I'll never get sober, sober, sober you
Sober you, sober you
Yeah, I'll never get, I'll never get
